# Hi! Thanks for checking out my work. Here are some of the Data Science Projects I've completed:

[Project 1:HR Analytics: Predicting Employee Attrition](https://github.com/Ait0shi/HR_Analytics)
This project uses Logistic Regression and Random Forest Classification to predict features that affect employee turnover. 

[Project 2: Spotify Recommender Systems](https://github.com/Ait0shi/SpotifyRecommender)
This machine-learning project uses Euclidean Distance and Cosine Similarity to suggest songs based on user input. Calculations are based on similarity by genre, then popularity. This approach includes Exploratory Data Analysis, Normalization and encoding of categorical features, Model Deployment, and Evaluation.

[Project 3: Product Categorization System](https://github.com/Ait0shi/Product_Categorization)
This machine learning project uses the price runner file to create a machine learning program that predicts categories for new products within the system.

[Project 4: Weather Forecast Application](https://github.com/Ait0shi/Weather_Forecast_Application)
Description: This Python program allows users to look up the weather for any location input either by City, State, Zip, or Country Code

[Project 5: Renewable Energy and Climate Change Data](https://github.com/Ait0shi/RenewableEnergyAndClimateChange)

Description: This R program aims to show the relationship between renewable energy and climate change by plotting changes in the use of renewable energy and climate indicators among major cities worldwide

[Project 6: Housing Data Analysis](https://github.com/Ait0shi/HousingAnalysis)
Description: This R program applies statistical correlation and multiple regression to determine if there is a relationship between Sales Price and predictors such as number of bedrooms, number of bathrooms, zip code, etc.

[Project 7: Netflix Viewership Analysis](https://github.com/Ait0shi/netflix_viewership_analysis/blob/main/NETFLIX.pdf)

Netflix, as a global streaming company, has played a major role in providing a platform for movies and shows around the world to be seen in different countries. Data from late 2021 through early this year shows that this strategic move is not only a fruitful venture but also
something that the company should invest more in. A table showing the top 3 English and non-English movies brings about a list of foreign films that have made their place as a cultural icon, not only in the United States but also worldwide.

[Project 8: The Randomosity of Lottery Drawings](https://github.com/Ait0shi/Lottery_Randomosity)
Can we use Machine Learning models to predict the next winning lottery numbers? This blog post showcases visualizes data from the Lottery Drawings using Power Bi

[Project 9: An analysis of childcare prices using Power Bi](https://github.com/Ait0shi/Childcare_Prices)
The National Database of Childcare Prices is a technical report developed by the U.S. Department of Labor Women’s Bureau to promote opportunities for women to find employment. This study tries to understand how childcare, or lack thereof, could be a hindrance to a woman’s ability to obtain or maintain a job. For this project, I wanted to focus on my city to understand how its statistics compare to the National Average

[Project 10: Hospital Readmissions](https://github.com/Ait0shi/Hospital_Readmissions)
This machine-learning project uses Logistic Regression and Random Forest Classification to predict a diabetic patient's likelihood of hospital readmission.
