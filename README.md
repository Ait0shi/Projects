# Feel free to explore the different data science projects I've worked on!

[Project 1: Hospital Readmissions](https://github.com/Ait0shi/Hospital_Readmissions)
This machine-learning project uses Logistic Regression and Random Forest Classification to predict a diabetic patient's likelihood of hospital readmission.

[Project 2: Spotify Recommender Systems](https://github.com/Ait0shi/SpotifyRecommender)
This machine-learning project uses Euclidean Distance and Cosine Similarity to suggest songs based on user input. Calculations are based on similarity by genre, then popularity. This approach includes Exploratory Data Analysis, Normalization and encoding of categorical features, Model Deployment, and Evaluation.

[Project 3: Product Categorization System](https://github.com/Ait0shi/Product_Categorization)
This machine learning project uses the price runner file to create a machine learning program that predicts categories for new products within the system.

[Project 4: Weather Forecast Application](https://github.com/Ait0shi/Weather_Forecast_Application)
Description: This Python program allows users to look up the weather for any location input either by City, State, Zip, or Country Code

[Project 5: Renewable Energy and Climate Change Data](https://github.com/Ait0shi/RenewableEnergyAndClimateChange)

Description: This R program aims to show the relationship between renewable energy and climate change by plotting changes in the use of renewable energy and climate indicators among major cities worldwide

[Project 6: Housing Data Analysis](https://github.com/Ait0shi/HousingAnalysis)
Description: This R program applies statistical correlation and multiple regression to determine if there is a relationship between Sales Price and predictors such as number of bedrooms, number of bathrooms, zip code, etc.
